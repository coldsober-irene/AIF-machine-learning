# DOCUMENTATIONS
# This code will train a random forest model on the data in X_train and y_train, and then make predictions on the test data in X_test. 
# It will then evaluate the accuracy of the model's predictions using the accuracy_score function from the sklearn.metrics module.

# The RandomForestClassifier class takes a number of parameters that allow you to customize the behavior of the algorithm. For example, 
# the n_estimators parameter sets the number of trees in the forest, and the random_state parameter sets the random seed for reproducibility.

# It's important to note that this is just a simple example, and in practice, you may need to preprocess the data, 
# tune the parameters and evaluate the model using other metrics as well, depending on the characteristics of the problem and the data.
